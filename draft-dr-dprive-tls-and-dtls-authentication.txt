              draft-dr-dprive-profiles-for-tls-and-dtls-01

Abstract

   This document describes how a DNS client can use a domain name to
   authenticate a DNS server that uses Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   and Datagram TLS (DTLS).  Additionally, it defines (D)TLS profiles
   for DNS clients and servers implementing DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-
   DTLS.

Internet-Draft            (D)TLS Authentication            November 2015


   To address the concerns in [RFC7626] the DPRIVE working group has two
   active documents that provide DNS privacy between DNS clients and DNS
   servers:

   o  DNS-over-TLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls]

   o  DNS-over-DTLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls]

   This document defines authentication profiles for DTLS [RFC6347] and
   TLS [RFC5246] that specify how a DNS client should authenticate a DNS
   server, based on a domain name associated with that server.  In
   particular, it describes:

   o  How a DNS client can obtain a domain name for a DNS server.

   o  What are the acceptable credentials a DNS server can present to
      prove its control over a given domain name.

   o  How a DNS client can verify that any given credential matches the
      domain name for the server.

   [TODO: Is 'profile' the best word to use here for authentication
   profiles?]

   This document also defines a (D)TLS protocol profile for use with
   DNS.  This profile defines the configuration options and protocol
   extensions required of both parties to optimize connection
   establishment and resumption for transporting DNS, and to support the
   authentication profiles defined here.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Several terms are used specifically in the context of this draft:

   o  DNS client: a DNS stub implementation or forwarder/proxy.  A DNS
      client receives requests from an application or a system and sends
      them to some pre-configured set of upstream DNS servers for
      resolution.  In the case of a forwarder, we use the term "DNS
      client" to discuss side that originates queries.

   o  DNS server: a DNS Recursive resolver or forwarder/proxy.  In the
      case of a forwarder, we use the term "DNS server" to discuss the
      side that responds to queries.

Internet-Draft            (D)TLS Authentication            November 2015


   o  Reference Identifier: a Reference Identifier as described in
      [RFC6125], constructed by the DNS client when connecting to the
      DNS server.

   o  Credential: Information provided by a DNS server which proves its
      identity.  Covered credentials include:

      *  X.509 certificate

      *  DNSSEC chain to TLSA record

   o  SPKI Pinsets: [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls] describes the use of
      cryptographic digests to "pin" public key information in a manner
      similar to HPKP [RFC7469].  An SPKI pinset is a collection of
      these pins that constrains a DNS server.

   o  (D)TLS: Transport Layer Security [RFC5246] and (possibly) Datagram
      Transport Layer Security [RFC6347]

   o  DNS privacy server: A DNS server that:

      *  MUST implement DNS-over-TLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls] and
         MAY implement DNS-over-DTLS [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls].

      *  Can offer at least one of the credentials described in
         Section 9.

      *  Implements the (D)TLS profile described in Section 12.

      [QUESTION: This assumes that all servers that implement DNS-over-
      DTLS will be required to implement DNS-over-TLS to support
      truncation.  This is implied in the msg-flows draft but isn't yet
      stated in the current DNS-over-DTLS draft.  But I believe it will
      be in the next version? ]

3.  Scope

   This document is limited to strong, domain-name-based authentication
   of DNS servers by DNS clients (as defined in the terminology
   section), and the TLS profiles needed to support this.  As such, the
   following things are out of scope:

   o  Authentication of authoritative servers by recursive resolvers.

   o  Authentication of DNS clients by DNS servers.

   o  SPKI-pinset-based authentication.  This is defined in
      [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls].  However, this document does
      describe how to combine the two mechanisms in Section 10.

   o  Any server identifier other than domain names, including IP
      address, organizational name, country of origin, etc.

4.  Discussion

4.1.  Background

   DNS privacy requires encrypting the query (and response) to protect
   against passive attacks.  Such encryption typically provides
   integrity protection as a side-effect, which means on-path attackers
   cannot simply inject bogus DNS responses.  However, to provide
   protection against active attackers pretending to be the server, the
   client must authenticate the server.

4.2.  Bootstrapping Problems

   Many TLS clients use PKIX authentication [RFC6125] based on a domain
   name for the server they are contacting.  These clients typically
   first look up the server's network address in the DNS before making
   this connection.  A DNS client therefore has a bootstrap problem.
   DNS clients typically know only the IP address of a DNS server.

   As such, before connecting to its recursive resolver, a DNS client
   needs to learn the domain name it should associated with the IP
   address of a DNS server.

4.3.  DNSSEC

   The use of DANE adds requirements on the ability of the client get
   validated DNSSEC results.  This is discussed in more detail in
   Section 9.2.

4.4.  ...

   [TODO: More discussion needed....]

5.  SRV Service Label

   This specification adds a SRV service label "domains" for privacy-
   preserving DNS servers.

   Example service records (for TLS and DTLS respectively):

      _domains._tcp SRV 0 1 853 dns.example.com.

Internet-Draft            (D)TLS Authentication            November 2015


      _domains._udp SRV 0 1 853 dns.example.com.

6.  Authentication in Opportunistic DNS-over-(D)TLS

   An Opportunistic Security [RFC7435] profile is described in
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls] which MAY be used for both DNS-over-
   TLS and DNS-over-DTLS.

   DNS clients issuing queries under an opportunistic profile which know
   of a domain name for a DNS server MAY choose to try to authenticate
   the server using the mechanisms described here.  This is useful for
   debugging or diagnostic purposes if there are means to report the
   result of the authentication attempt.

   DNS clients with multiple resolvers configured with any sort of
   automatic selection (e.g. failover) MUST NOT mix opportunistically-
   configured resolvers or non-(D)TLS resolvers with strictly-configured
   (D)TLS resolvers.  Doing so would invalidate the protections offered
   against an active attacker.  [SARA: I think I see what you are
   getting at here, but I think of it that the 'profile' is a setting
   that applies to the resolution of a particular query, it is not a
   property a DNS server (nor the client).  And so I think that is true
   of both opportunistic or strict.]

7.  Authentication for Strict (D)TLS Privacy

   To authenticate a server providing DNS privacy, the DNS client needs
   to know the domain name for each DNS privacy server it is willing to
   contact.  This is necessary to protect against active attacks on DNS
   privacy.

   A DNS client requiring strict privacy MUST either use one of the
   sources listed in Section 8 to obtain a domain name for the server it
   contacts, or use an SPKI pinset as described in
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls].

   A DNS client requiring strict privacy MUST only attempt to connect to
   DNS servers for which either a domain name or a SPKI pinset is known
   (or both).  The client MUST use the available verification mechanisms
   described in Section 9 to authenticate the server, and MUST abort
   connections to a server when no verification mechanism succeeds.

   With Strict privacy, the DNS client MUST signal to the user when none
   of the DNS privacy servers are available, and MUST NOT provide DNS
   service until at least one of the DNS privacy servers becomes
   available.

   [ TODO: discuss situations where one name is sufficient for all IP
   addresses, or whether we want to mandate a strict one-to-one mapping
   of names to IP addresses ]

   A DNS privacy server may be temporarily unavailable when configuring
   a network.  For example, for clients on networks that require
   registration through web-based login (a.k.a. "captive portals"), such
   registration may rely on DNS interception and spoofing.  Techniques
   such as those used by DNSSEC-trigger [dnssec-trigger] MAY be used
   during network configuration, with the intent to transition to the
   designated strict DNS privacy servers after captive portal
   registration.  The user MUST be alerted that the DNS is not private
   during such bootstrap.

8.  Out of Band Sources of Domain Name

8.1.  Full direct configuration

   DNS clients may be directly and securely provisioned with the domain
   name of each DNS privacy server.  For example, using a configuration
   file or API.

   In this case, direct configuration for a DNS client would consist of
   both an IP address and a domain name for each DNS server.

   [ TODO: should we offer choice of port here as well as name and IP
   address? ] [SARA: No, I don't think we need to do that.]

8.2.  Direct configuration of name only

   [ TODO: do we want to keep this section? ]

   A DNS client may be configured directly with only the domain name of
   its DNS privacy server.

   It can then use opportunistic DNS connections to untrusted DNS
   servers (e.g. provided by the local DHCP service) to establish the IP
   address of the intended privacy-preserving DNS server by doing a
   lookup of SRV records.

   Example: For a DNS client configured in this way to do strict DNS
   privacy to dns.example.net, it would opportunistically look up the
   SRV for _domains._tcp.dns.example.net and determine addresses (via
   opportunistic A and/or AAAA lookups) for the resulting SRV
   response(s).

Internet-Draft            (D)TLS Authentication            November 2015


   A DNS client so configured that successfully connects to a configured
   DNS privacy server MAY choose to locally cache the looked up
   addresses in order to not have to repeat the opportunistic lookup.

   [ TODO: specify how long such caching is acceptable?  Is this limited
   to the TTL or can we make an exception? ]

8.3.  DHCP

   Some clients may have an established trust relationship with a known
   DHCP [RFC2131] server for discovering their network configuraton.  In
   the typical case, such a DHCP server provides a list of IP addresses
   for DNS servers (see section 3.8 of [RFC2132]), but does not provide
   a domain name for the DNS server itself.

   A DHCP server might use a DHCP extension to provide a list of domain
   names for the offered DNS servers, which correspond to IP addresses
   listed.

   [ TODO: do we want to define this new DHCP extension now or to punt
   on it to a future document? ]

   Note that this requires the client to trust the DHCP server, and to
   have a secured/authenticated connection to it.  Therefore this
   mechanism may be limited to only certain environments.  This document
   does not attempt to describe secured and trusted relationships to
   DHCP servers.

   [NOTE: We talked to the DHCP folks and they stated that they are
   working on securing IPv6, but that they don't expect IPv4 to be
   secured. ]

9.  Credential Verification

9.1.  X.509 Certificate Based Authentication

   When a DNS client configured with a domain name connects to its
   configured DNS server over TLS or DTLS, the server may present it
   with an X.509 certificate.  The DNS client uses [RFC6125] validation
   techniques to compare the domain name to the certificate provided.

   A DNS client constructs two Reference Identifiers for the server
   based on the domain name: A DNS-ID and an SRV-ID [RFC4985].  The DNS-
   ID is simply the domain name itself.  The SRV-ID uses a "_domains."
   prefix.  So if the configured domain name is "dns.example.com", then
   the two Reference Identifiers are:

      DNS-ID: dns.example.com

Internet-Draft            (D)TLS Authentication            November 2015


      SRV-ID: _domains.dns.example.com

   If either of the Reference Identifiers are found in the X.509
   certificate's subjectAltName extension as described in section 6 of
   [RFC6125], the DNS client should accept the certificate for the
   server.

   [ TODO: do we want to talk about multiple domain names for a single
   server here? ]

   A compliant DNS client MUST only inspect the certificate's
   subjectAltName extension for these Reference Identifiers.  In
   particular, it MUST NOT inspect the Subject field itself.

9.2.  DANE

   DANE [RFC6698] provides mechanisms to root certificate and raw public
   keys trust with DNSSEC.  However this requires a domain name which
   must be obtained via a trusted out of band source.

   It is noted that Section 9.2 says "Clients that validate the DNSSEC
   signatures themselves MUST use standard DNSSEC validation procedures.
   Clients that rely on another entity to perform the DNSSEC signature
   validation MUST use a secure mechanism between themselves and the
   validator."

   [ TODO: what specific DANE record should be looked up?
   _853._tcp.dns.example.com for TLS? _853._udp.dns.example.com for
   DTLS? ]

9.2.1.  Direct DNS Lookup

   The DNS client MAY choose to perform the DNS lookups to retrieve the
   required DANE records itself.  The DNS queries for such DANE records
   MAY use opportunistic encryption or be in the clear to avoid trust
   recursion.

9.2.2.  TLS DNSSEC Chain extension

   The DNS client MAY offer the TLS extension described in
   [I-D.shore-tls-dnssec-chain-extension].  If the DNS server supports
   this extension, it can provide the full chain to the client in the
   handshake.

Internet-Draft            (D)TLS Authentication            November 2015


   If the DNS client offers the TLS DNSSEC Chain extension, it MUST be
   capable of validating the full DNSSEC authentication chain down to
   the leaf.  If the supplied DNSSEC chain does not validate, the client
   MUST ignore the DNSSEC chain and validate only via other supplied
   credentials.

   [ TODO: specify guidance for DANE parameters to be used here.  For
   example, a suggestion to use Certificate Usage of 3 (EE-DANE)
   (section 2.1.1 of [RFC6698]) and a Selector of 1 (SPKI) (section
   2.1.2) would completely remove all X.509 and certificate authorities
   from the verification path and allows for private certification ]

   [ TODO: discuss combination of DNSSEC Chain Extension with cert
   validation.  Note that the combination depends on the Certificate
   Usage value of the TLSA response. ]

10.  Combined Credentials with SPKI Pinsets

   A DNS client that is configured with both a domain name and a SPKI
   pinset for a DNS sever should match on both a valid credential for
   the domain name and a valid SPKI pinset when connecting to that DNS
   server.

   [ TODO: describe in more detail why this conservative approach is the
   right one, and what implementations should do if they want a more
   lenient approach. ]

11.  Server capability probing and caching by DNS clients

   [DKG: not sure about this section -- this seems to be slipping away
   from strong authentication or profiling, so i think it is out of
   scope.][SARA: I think this covers some aspects unique to DNS that
   apply to both TLS and DTLS.  For example 2 protocols are available
   for encryption and typically multiple DNS servers.  It should be
   somewhere in a document which covers both protocols.]

   Deployment of both DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-DTLS will be gradual.
   Not all servers will support one or both of these protocols and the
   well-known port might be blocked by some middleboxes.  Clients will
   be expected to keep track of servers that support TLS and/or DTLS,
   and those that have been previously authenticated.

   If no server capability information is available then (unless
   otherwise specified by the configuration of the DNS client) DNS
   clients that implement both TLS and DTLS SHOULD try to authenticate
   using both protocols before failing or falling back to a lower
   security.  DNS clients using opportunistic security SHOULD try all
   available servers in order to obtain an authenticated encrypted

   connection before falling back to a lower security.  (RATIONALE: This
   approach can increase latency while discovering server capabilities
   but maximizes the chance of sending the query over an authenticated
   encrypted connection.)

   [QUESTION: Should we make recommendations about what to do if a
   previously authenticated server starts failing authentication?]

12.  (D)TLS Protocol Profile

   This section defines the protocol profile of DNS-over-DTLS and DNS-
   over-TLS.

   There are known attacks on TLS, such as machine-in-the-middle and
   protocol downgrade.  These are general attacks on TLS and not
   specific to DNS-over-TLS; please refer to the TLS RFCs for discussion
   of these security issues.  Clients and servers MUST adhere to the TLS
   implementation recommendations and security considerations of
   [RFC7525] except with respect to TLS version.  Since encryption of
   DNS using (D)TLS is virtually a green-field deployment DNS clients
   and server MUST implement only (D)TLS 1.2 or later.

   Implmentations MUST NOT offer or provide TLS compression, since
   compression can leak significant amounts of information, especially
   to a network observer capable of forcing the user to do an arbitrary
   DNS lookup in the style of the CRIME attacks [CRIME].

   Implementations compliant with this profile MUST implement all of the
   following items:

   o  TLS session resumption without server-side state [RFC5077] which
      eliminates the need for the server to retain cryptographic state
      for longer than necessary.

   o  Raw public keys [RFC7250] which reduce the size of the
      ServerHello, and can be used by clients that cannot obtain
      certificates (e.g., DNS servers on private networks).

   Implementations compliant with this profile SHOULD implement all of
   the following items:

   o  TLS False Start [I-D.ietf-tls-falsestart] which reduces round-
      trips by allowing the TLS second flight of messages
      (ChangeCipherSpec) to also contain the (encrypted) DNS query

   o  Cached Information Extension [I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info] which
      avoids transmitting the server's certificate and certificate chain
      if the client has cached that information from a previous TLS
      handshake

   Relevant DNS extensions for DNS clients and DNS servers using (D)TLS
   [TODO: does this belong elsewhere in the draft or in another
   document?]  [SARA: I think a separate section in this document would
   be the best place.]

   o  EDNS(0) padding [I-D.mayrhofer-edns0-padding], which allows
      encrypted queries and responses to hide their size as a defence
      against traffic analysis.

   o  Client Subnet in DNS Queries [I-D.ietf-dnsop-edns-client-subnet],
      which potentially leaks client address information to the upstream
      authoritative DNS servers.  A DNS client ought to be able to
      inform the DNS Resolver that it does not want any address
      information leaked.

   [NOTE: The references to (works in progress) should be upgraded to
   MUST's if those references become RFC's prior to publication of this
   document.]

   Guidance specific to TLS or DTLS is provided in either
   [I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls] or [I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls].
