            This document describes how a DNS client can use a domain
            name to authenticate a recursive DNS resolver that uses
            Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram TLS
            (DTLS). Additionally, it defines (D)TLS profiles for DNS
            clients and servers implementing DNS-over-TLS and
            DNS-over-DTLS.

      <section title="Introduction">
            <t>To address the concerns in <xref target="RFC7626"/> the DPRIVE working group has 
               two active documents that provide DNS

            <t>
              This document defines authentication profiles for <xref

              target="RFC5246">TLS</xref> that specify how a DNS stub
              client or forwarder should authenticate the DNS
              recursive resolver it talks to, based on a domain name
              associated with that resolver.  In particular, it
              describes:

              This document also defines a (D)TLS protocol profile for

              options and protocol extensions required of both parties
              to optimize connection establishment and resumption for

        <section title="Discussion">
          <section title="Background">
            <t>
              DNS privacy requires encrypting the query (and response)
              to protect against passive attacks. Such encryption
              typically provides integrity protection as a side-effect,
              which means on-path attackers cannot simply inject bogus
              DNS responses. However, to provide protection against
              active attackers pretending to be the server, the client
              must authenticate the server.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="Bootstrapping Problems">
            <t>
              Many TLS clients use <xref target="RFC6125">PKIX
              authentication</xref> based on a domain name for the
              server they are contacting.  These clients typically
              first look up the server's network address in the DNS
              before making this connection. A DNS client therefore
              has a bootstrap problem.
            </t>
            <t>
              As such, before connecting to its recursive resolver, a
              DNS client needs to learn both the resolver's IP address
              and its domain name.
            </t>
          </section>
          <section title="...">
            <t>[TODO: More discussion needed....]</t>
          </section>
        </section>

        <section title="Authentication in Opportunistic DNS (D)TLS Clients" anchor="opportunistic">
          <t>
            An <xref target="RFC7435">Opportunistic Security</xref>
            profile is described in <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls"/> which MAY be used
            for both DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-DTLS.
          </t>
          <t>
            DNS client implementations operating under this
            opportunistic profile which know of a domain name for
            their server MAY choose to try to authenticate the server
            using the mechanisms described here for debugging or
            diagnostic purposes if they have a means of reporting on
            the state of server authentication to their caller.
          </t>
          <t>
            DNS client implementations with multiple resolvers
            configured with any sort of automatic selection
            (e.g. failover) MUST NOT mix opportunistically-configured
            resolvers or non-(D)TLS resolvers with strictly-configured
            (D)TLS resolvers. Doing so would invalidate the
            protections offered against an active attacker.
          </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Strict TLS Profile">
            <t>To authenticate the server providing DNS privacy, the DNS client
               needs to be obtain reference identifier(s) for each DNS privacy server.
                For the Strict TLS profile the DNS client MUST use 
                at least one of the sources listed in 
                <xref target="OABSources"/> and <xref target="IBSources"/> to 
                obtain reference identifier(s) for available DNS servers. 
                The client MUST only use DNS
                servers for which at least one reference identifier is available. The client 
                MUST use one of the Authentication Profiles described
                in section <xref target="credentials"/> to authenticate the server.
                This allows the DNS client to detect on-path attacks. </t>

            <t>[QUESTION: Should we specify some minimum set of requirements here
                with regard to sources/identifiers/auth profiles?]</t>
                
            <t> With Strict TLS, the DNS client MUST signal to the user
                when none of the DNS privacy servers are available, 
                and MUST NOT provide DNS service until at least one of the
                DNS privacy servers becomes available.</t>

            <t> A DNS privacy server may be temporarily unavailable when
                configuring a network.  For example, for clients on networks that
                require authentication through web-based login, such authentication
                may rely on DNS interception and spoofing.  Techniques such as those
                used by DNSSEC-trigger [dnssec-trigger] MAY be used during network
                configuration, with the intent to transition to the designated DNS
                provider after authentication.  The user MUST be alerted that the DNS
                is not private during such bootstrap.</t>

                       Several things make this mechanism particularly attractive.
                       In particular it reduces latency by obtaining the DANE records
                       during the TLS handshake and these records in the TLS handshake will be encrypted in 
                       TLS 1.3. </t>

            <t>Deployment of both DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-DTLS 
               will be gradual.  Not all servers will support one or both of these
               protocols and the
               well-known port might be blocked by some middleboxes. Clients will be
               expected to keep track of servers that support TLS and/or DTLS, and those that
               have been previously authenticated.</t>

           <t> If no server capability information is available then (unless otherwise specified 
               by the configuration of the
               DNS client) DNS clients that implement both TLS and DTLS SHOULD try to authenticate
               using both protocols
               before failing or falling back to a
               lower security. DNS clients using opportunistic security SHOULD try all available servers
               in order to obtain an authenticated encrypted connection
               before falling back to a lower security. (RATIONALE: This approach can increase latency while discovering
               server capabilities but maximizes the chance of sending the query over an authenticated
               encrypted connection.) </t>

        <section title="(D)TLS Protocol Profile" anchor="tls-profile">
            <t>This section defines the protocol profile of DNS-over-DTLS and
               DNS-over-TLS.</t>

               <t>There are known attacks on TLS, such as person-in-the-middle and
               protocol downgrade.  These are general attacks on TLS and not
               specific to DNS-over-TLS; please refer to the TLS RFCs for
               discussion of these security issues.  Clients and servers MUST
               adhere to the TLS implementation recommendations and security
               considerations of <xref target="RFC7525"/> except with respect to TLS version.
               Since encryption of DNS using (D)TLS is virtually a green-field deployment 
               DNS clients and server MUST implement only (D)TLS 1.2 until a 
               higher version is available.</t>

               <t>Implementations compliant with this profile MUST implement all of
               the following items:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                <t><xref target="RFC5077">TLS session resumption without server-side state</xref>
                    which eliminates the need for the server to retain cryptographic
                    state for longer than necessary.</t>
               <t><xref target="RFC7250">Raw public keys</xref>
                   which reduce the size of the ServerHello, and can be used by clients
                   that cannot obtain certificates (e.g., DNS resolvers on private networks). </t>
                </list></t>

                <t>Implementations compliant with this profile SHOULD implement all of
                   the following items:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-falsestart">TLS False Start</xref>
                   which reduces round-trips by allowing the TLS second flight of 
                   messages (ChangeCipherSpec) to also contain the (encrypted) DNS query</t>
               
                <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info">Cached Information Extension</xref>
                    which avoids transmitting the server's certificate and certificate 
                    chain if the client has cached that information from a previous TLS handshake</t>
