        <section title="Introduction">
            <t>To address the concerns in [RFC7626] the DPRIVE working group has 
               two active documents that provide DNS
               privacy:

                </list>
            </t>

            <t> This document defines authentication profiles for DTLS [RFC6347] 
                and TLS [RFC5246] that specify how DNS clients should authenticate
                DNS servers. 
                This draft describes both how DNS clients can obtain reference identifiers
                for DNS servers and how those identifiers should be used to 
                authenticate a DNS server.</t>

            <t> The scope of this document is limited to DNS 
                clients authenticating Iterative Resolvers. Authentication of 
                DNS clients by DNS servers is out of scope of 
                this document.</t>

            <t>This document also defines a (D)TLS protocol profile for DNS-over-TLS and 
               DNS-over-DTLS. This profile defines the
               configuration options and protocol extensions required to optimize 
               connection establishment and resumption, and support the authentication profiles.</t>

        <section title="Discussion">
            <t>DNS privacy requires encrypting the query (and response) to protect 
                against passive 
                attacks. Such encryption typically provides integrity protection as 
                a side-effect, which means on-path attackers cannot simply inject 
                bogus DNS responses. However, to provide stronger protection from 
                active attackers pretending to be the server, the server itself 
                needs to be authenticated. </t>

            <t>Many applications use PKIX authentication [add ref] based on a list of acceptable 
                reference identifiers, which are in turn based on the source domain [RFC6125]. That source domain is 
                typically obtained via DNS. Therefore DNS is in a rather unique position
                because this trust recursion leads to an authentication bootstrap problem.</t>

            <t>[TODO: More discussion needed....]</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Opportunistic Privacy Profile">

           <t>An Opportunistic Privacy profile is described in 
              <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dns-over-tls"/> which
              MAY be used for both DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-DTLS.</t>

               <t>When performing opportunistic privacy the client MUST authenticate the 
                  DNS server using one of of the authentication profiles described here.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Strict TLS Profile">
            <t>To authenticate the server providing DNS privacy, the DNS client
               needs to be obtain reference identifier(s) for each DNS privacy server.
                For the Strict TLS profile the DNS client MUST use 
                at least one of the sources listed in 
                <xref target="OABSources"/> and <xref target="IBSources"/> to 
                obtain reference identifier(s) for available DNS servers. 
                The client MUST only use DNS
                servers for which at least one reference identifier is available. The client 
                MUST use one of the Authentication Profiles described
                in section <xref target="Auth"/> to authenticate the server.
                This allows the DNS client to detect on-path attacks. </t>

            <t>[QUESTION: Should we specify some minimum set of requirements here
                with regard to sources/identifiers/auth profiles?]</t>
                
            <t> With Strict TLS, the DNS client MUST signal to the user
                when none of the DNS privacy servers are available, 
                and MUST NOT provide DNS service until at least one of the
                DNS privacy servers becomes available.</t>

            <t> A DNS privacy server may be temporarily unavailable when
                configuring a network.  For example, for clients on networks that
                require authentication through web-based login, such authentication
                may rely on DNS interception and spoofing.  Techniques such as those
                used by DNSSEC-trigger [dnssec-trigger] MAY be used during network
                configuration, with the intent to transition to the designated DNS
                provider after authentication.  The user MUST be alerted that the DNS
                is not private during such bootstrap.</t>

        <section title="Out of Band Sources of Reference Identifier" anchor="OABSources">
            <section title="Direct configuration">
                <t>DNS clients may be directly and securely provisioned with 
                    reference identifiers e.g. via a configuration file or API.</t>
            </section>

            <section title="DHCP">
                <t>In the future reference identifiers (e.g. certificate names) 
                    might be available in /etc/resolv.conf. However
                    this will require assignment of a new DHCP option for each reference identifier.</t>

                <t>[QUESTION: Should we discuss in more detail what can go in here? 
                   Cert name, SPKI fingerprint, etc....]  [QUESTION: Do we want to do explore new DHCP options now?]
                   </t>

                <t>This also raises
                    the question of trust in the DHCP server (e.g. while roaming), and of the security of the
                    connection to the DHCP server. Therefore this mechanism may be limited to
                    only certain environments.</t>
                <t>[NOTE: We talked to the DHCP folks and they stated that they are working on
                    securing IPv6, but that they don't expect IPv4 to be secured. ]</t>

            <section title="DANE">
                <t>DANE [RFC6698] provides mechanisms to root certificate and 
                   raw public keys trust with DNSSEC. However this requires a hostname
                   which must be obtained via a trusted out of band source.</t>
                   <section title="Direct DNS Lookup">
                       <t>The DNS client MAY choose to perform the DNS lookups to retrieve the
                       required DANE records itself. The DNS queries for such DANE records
                       MAY use opportunistic
                       encryption or be in the clear to avoid trust recursion.</t>
                   </section>
                   <section title="TLS DNSSEC Chain extension"><t> 
                       Alternatively the TLS extension described in

                       MAY be used if the DNS client and server support this.
                       Several things make this mechanism particularly attractive.
                       In particular it reduces latency by obtaining the DANE records
                       during the TLS handshake and these records in the TLS handshake will be encrypted in 
                       TLS 1.3. </t>

               protocols and the

               <t>There are known attacks on TLS, such as person-in-the-middle and
               protocol downgrade.  These are general attacks on TLS and not
               specific to DNS-over-TLS; please refer to the TLS RFCs for
               discussion of these security issues.  Clients and servers MUST
               adhere to the TLS implementation recommendations and security
               considerations of <xref target="RFC7525"/> except with respect to TLS version.
               Since encryption of DNS using (D)TLS is virtually a green-field deployment 
               DNS clients and server MUST implement only (D)TLS 1.2 until a 
               higher version is available.</t>

               <t>Implementations compliant with this profile MUST implement all of
               the following items:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                <t><xref target="RFC5077">TLS session resumption without server-side state</xref>
                    which eliminates the need for the server to retain cryptographic
                    state for longer than necessary.</t>
               <t><xref target="RFC7250">Raw public keys</xref>
                   which reduce the size of the ServerHello, and can be used by clients
                   that cannot obtain certificates (e.g., DNS resolvers on private networks). </t>
                </list></t>

                <t>Implementations compliant with this profile SHOULD implement all of
                   the following items:</t>
                <t><list style="symbols">
                <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-falsestart">TLS False Start</xref>
                   which reduces round-trips by allowing the TLS second flight of 
                   messages (ChangeCipherSpec) to also contain the (encrypted) DNS query</t>
               
                <t><xref target="I-D.ietf-tls-cached-info">Cached Information Extension</xref>
                    which avoids transmitting the server's certificate and certificate 
                    chain if the client has cached that information from a previous TLS handshake</t>
                </list></t>

                <t>[NOTE: The references to (works in progress) should be upgraded to 
                    MUST's if those references become RFC's prior to publication of this document.]</t>

                <t>Guidance specific to TLS or DTLS is provided in either
                    <xref target="I-D.ietf-dprive-dnsodtls"/> or
